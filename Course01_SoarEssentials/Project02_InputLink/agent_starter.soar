## The relevant memory graph schema for the input link and the input that appears there is as follows:
#   <s> ^io ID
#           ^input-link ID
#               ^priorities ID
#                   ^<attr> INT/FLOAT
#               ^candidate-supplier ID
#                   ^name STRING

## These two Soar CLI commands load a Soar file from the parent directory.
cd ".."
load file "fake_agent_input.soar"

## A rule that prints the name of any candidate supplier that appears on the input link.
# sp {elaborate*suppliersort-main*input*supplier-name
#     "Anything inside these quotes is a documentation string for this rule. 
#     Replace this text with a description of what this rule does."
#     # FIXME: Replace the underscores with the correct WM path to access the supplier name
#     (state <s> ^___ <sup-name>)
#     -->
#     # FIXME: Replace the underscores with code so that this rule 
#     #  will print the supplier name that matched on the left-hand side of this rule,
#     #  as well as a newline at the end of the message.
#     # (Generate a newline using the (crlf) RHS function.)
#     (write |INPUT: Supplier candidate: | ___ ___)}

## A rule that prints the name of any config priority value that appears on the input link.
# sp {elaborate*suppliersort-main*input*config-priorities
#     "(write documentation here)"
#     # FIXME: Try writing the entire LHS from scratch! :)
#     # Be sure that your conditions define <attr> and <val> so they can be used on the RHS of this rule.
#     # (Remember that <variables> can stand in for either attributes or values.)
# 
#     -->
#     (write |INPUT WEIGHT: | <attr> |: | <weight> (crlf))}
